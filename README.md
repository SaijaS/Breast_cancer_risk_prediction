# Breast_cancer_risk_prediction
 This project aims to enhance the understanding of breast cancer prognosis and refine prediction models for patient outcomes. By utilizing advanced statistical methods and machine learning techniques, the project seeks to analyze survival trends and accurately predict long-term survival rates for breast cancer patients.

Project Objectives
Survival Analysis: Use models like the Kaplan-Meier survival curve and Cox Proportional Hazards model to analyze survival trends and identify significant factors impacting survival.
Prediction of 10-Year Mortality: Build a machine learning model to predict the likelihood of a patient surviving or passing away within 10 years of diagnosis.
Insights into Treatment and Research: Identify critical factors influencing survival to optimize treatment strategies and guide future research.
